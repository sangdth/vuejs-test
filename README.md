4. Create a form for adding new participants to the table (remember to validate the form)
5. Make each participant editable by clicking on a table cell (inline editing)
6. Can delete row(s).
7. Write a developer-friendly installation guide on how to run the app
8. Push your code to a public [GitHub](https://github.com) repository
9. Deploy a live build on the internet

Upon completing the test, please push your code to a new public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com), deploy a live build on the internet, and email both links to sang.dang@polku.io.
